# Django E-commerce API Security Enhancements

This document summarizes all the security enhancements implemented for the Django E-commerce REST API to ensure strong security practices and avoid exposing confidential information.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### Custom User Model
- Implemented Django's custom user model with email as username
- Added role-based fields (buyer, seller, admin)

### JWT Authentication
- Implemented JWT authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Configured rotating refresh tokens with blacklist support
- Added token revocation on logout or password change

### Role-Based Permissions
- Created custom permission classes for role-based access control
- Implemented permissions for buyers, sellers, and admins
- Added owner-based permissions for resource access

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Added foundation for MFA implementation in authentication flows
- Created logging for suspicious activities

## 2. Password & Data Security

### Strong Password Policies
- Enforced minimum password length of 12 characters
- Added requirements for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- Implemented custom password validator to prevent common patterns

### Secure Password Storage
- Utilized Django's built-in PBKDF2 password hashing
- Configured proper salt generation and storage

### Field-Level Encryption
- Implemented encryption for sensitive data (phone numbers, messages)
- Created custom encrypted field types
- Added encryption key management via environment variables

## 3. Token & Session Management

### JWT Token Security
- Shortened access token lifetime to 15 minutes
- Implemented refresh token rotation with blacklist support
- Added token signing key rotation capability

### Session Security
- Enabled secure session cookies (HTTPS only)
- Implemented proper session management
- Added token revocation mechanisms

### Secret Management
- Moved all secrets to environment variables
- Created `.env.example` file with placeholders
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

## 4. Safe Git Practices

### Git Configuration
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` rules for sensitive files
- Excluded `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, and other sensitive files
- Created `.env.example` for developer onboarding

## 5. Rate Limiting & Throttling

### Authentication Rate Limiting
- Implemented rate limiting for login attempts (5/minute)
- Added throttling for registration endpoints
- Configured different rate limits for authenticated vs anonymous users

## 6. Security Middleware & Headers

### Security Middleware
- Added Django's built-in security middleware
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Added XSS and content type sniffing protection

### Security Headers
- Configured secure headers for all responses
- Implemented proper referrer policy
- Added frame protection

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- Implemented logging for failed login attempts
- Added logging for successful logins
- Created logging for password changes
- Added suspicious activity detection

### Audit Trail
- Created blacklisted token model for token revocation tracking
- Implemented user activity logging

## 8. Automated Testing

### Authentication Tests
- Created tests for user registration with password validation
- Implemented tests for login and logout flows
- Added tests for profile access and updates
- Created tests for role-based permissions

### Security Tests
- Implemented password validation tests
- Added tests for token revocation
- Created tests for rate limiting

## 9. Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Moved all sensitive configuration to environment variables
- Added support for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Created secure default values for development

### Configuration Files
- Updated `settings.py` to use environment variables
- Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Implemented different settings for development and production

## 10. Dependencies

### Security-Focused Packages
- Added `django-environ` for environment variable management
- Implemented `cryptography` for field-level encryption
- Added `django-csp` for Content Security Policy
- Updated `requirements.txt` with security-focused packages

## Implementation Summary

All security enhancements have been implemented following Django and REST API security best practices:

1. **Authentication Security**: Strong JWT implementation with proper token management
2. **Authorization Security**: Role-based access control with custom permissions
3. **Data Security**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
4. **Password Security**: Strong password policies and secure storage
5. **Transport Security**: HTTPS enforcement and secure headers
6. **Input Validation**: Proper validation and sanitization
7. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute-force attacks
8. **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
9. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for security events
10. **Testing**: Automated tests for all security features

These enhancements ensure the Django E-commerce REST API is secure, production-ready, and follows industry best practices for protecting sensitive data while ensuring no confidential information is exposed on GitHub.
